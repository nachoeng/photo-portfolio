# photo-portfolio

Hello world! My name is Ignacio and this is my first webpage.
It is a photo portfolio where the pictures appear as the user scrolls down, creating a very nice effect thanks to a CSS property called background-attachment: fixed;
Both the header and the footer are fixed and do not move when the user scrolls down.
Here are some images of said portfolio.
